9/15/22, 15:18 - Philipp: Why do i need to add courses all the time?
9/15/22, 15:18 - Martin: This is because you need a certain number of credits summed up at the end of your program

9/15/22, 15:20 - Philipp: That is plenty!
9/15/22, 15:20 - Martin: Reason why you should choose elective courses every semester to meet up
9/15/22, 15:21 - Philipp: So what if i do not meet up with the credits
9/15/22, 15:22 - Martin: Ohh no! then you won't graduate from here
9/15/22, 15:22 - Philipp: really!!
9/15/22, 15:22 - Martin: Yes, you must meet all requirements.
9/15/22, 15:23 - Philipp: Wait, what are the requirements for graduation?
9/15/22, 15:24 - Martin: you must reach at least 180 credits and validate all the courses involved
9/15/22, 15:24 - Philipp: but what if i fail a course?
9/15/22, 15:24 - Martin: : Lol, then you will have to resit the course at the end of the semester
9/15/22, 15:25 - Philipp: is that a good one?
9/15/22, 15:28 - Martin: Ofcourse not, it reduces your GPA especially if you fail again.
9/15/22, 15:29 - Philipp: Any other options?
9/15/22, 15:29 - Martin: Yes, you could also retake the course the following year
